# Boltzmann MoE — TODO

## 2026-09-12: inference-FLOPs work (see HANDOFF.md §7 for all evidence)

**Done**
- [x] Exact per-token FLOP model for `math_fet_boltz_hopfield_rep_*`
      (`scripts/analyze_moe_router_flops_20260912.py`). 603.59M MACs/token;
      MoE is 25.0%, lm_head 25.5%, GPT prefix 37.5%.
- [x] Measured real routing + branch magnitudes + paired-NLL ablation on 3 FET
      checkpoints (`scripts/measure_moe_routing_20260912.py`, job 1559723).
- [x] Answered the standing open question *"why does truncating to top-2 cost 6 PPL?"*
      — for the Hopfield-MEAN MoE it costs **nothing**, because routing is uniform
      (`eff_n = 7.999/8`) and the FF branch is inert. The 6 PPL belongs to the
      **w1w2** line, where routing carries real information (~3.9 PPL).
- [x] `train_utils.py:73` — `FFEnergyBase` added to the metrics isinstance gate.
      No `EnergyFF_*` run had ever logged routing-collapse metrics.
- [x] `head_dim` decoupled from `hidden_size/num_heads` in `EnergyAttention_QK`,
      enabling over-complete heads (`num_heads*head_dim > d`). Default unchanged;
      forward+backward verified, partial RoPE already supported (`rope.py:118`).
- [x] Single-block all-MoE architecture family + FLOP/param calculator
      (`scripts/design_single_block_moe_20260912.py`), 7 configs emitted to
      `configs/single_block_moe/`.
- [x] Grouped (sort-by-expert) sparse inference path + throughput benchmark
      (`scripts/bench_moe_throughput_20260912.py`) — closes the TODO below about
      needing a real dispatch to measure anything.

**Next**
- [ ] **Fit the rank-r proxy router** on the cached `(x, E_k)` pairs in
      `results/router_analysis/router_fit_cache__*.pt` (frozen backbone). For
      Hopfield the ceiling is 96.7% top-1 at r=16; for w1w2 the projection-based
      ceiling estimate plateaus near 0.5 and is **non-monotone in r**, which is not
      a credible ceiling curve — extend r up to d (=768) to validate the estimator,
      and prefer fitting a head directly on `(x, E_k)` over projecting x.
- [x] **Repulsion loss was mis-specified** — FIXED (`repulsion_form`, default
      `squared`). `L_rep = λ·E[cos]` is minimised at cos = −1 and rewards
      anti-alignment: both FET-rep and h1 sit within ~3% of the geometric floor
      `−1/(K−1)`. **But it is NOT the cause of the dead branch** — h1 runs λ=0.1
      (10× FET's) and is 86% load-bearing. Use `abs` to preserve the existing λ
      sweeps; `squared` is ~3× weaker at the same λ. Re-sweep λ either way.
- [ ] **The real root cause: the Hopfield output prefactor `4/I_e`.**
      `mean ‖g_k‖` = 0.019 (Hopfield) vs 155.66 (legacy w1w2) — 8,200×, of which
      256× is the bare constant (`energy_ff.py:644` `4/I_e` = 0.0039 vs
      `mlp.py:693` no prefactor at all). `scale_ff` = 1.52 cannot bridge that.
      Change `4/I_e → 1/√I_e` on the Hopfield output and re-run. Fixing repulsion
      alone will NOT revive this line.
- [x] Scale-free routing — DONE (`routing_norm ∈ {none, zscore, sqrt_width}` on
      `BoltzmannMoEFFEnergy._logits`). `zscore` normalises to unit std across
      experts, so pair it with `temperature ≈ 0.35` to reach `eff_n ≈ 2`; plain
      z-score alone only reaches `eff_n` 5.6–6.4 of 8.
- [ ] Re-check the FF-branch strength of the remaining `math_fet_hopfield_mean_r*`
      register variants — the whole Hopfield-MEAN line measures 1.6–10.9% FF share
      vs 85.8% for w1w2, so published deltas in that family may be comparing
      near-inert branches.
- [ ] DROPPED: "route once at iteration 0, reuse for 1..T". Iteration-to-iteration
      argmax agreement is 0.27–0.30 on the w1w2 line (TV 0.24–0.27) — routing
      genuinely changes with depth. The 0.87–0.90 agreement on the Hopfield model
      was an artefact of its degenerate uniform routing.
- [ ] Train one `configs/single_block_moe/` point once the throughput numbers justify
      it. Note the recurrence tax: k/K must be ≲ 1/T to stay at parity with a
      conventional dense transformer at iso-total-params.

## After Mon 2026-06-01 talk

### A/B test: tanh_exact φ' (DONE — surprising negative result, follow-up needed)

**Result (2026-06-01)**: `tanh_exact` lost decisively to `sigmoid` at h1_boltz_fullsize scale, 30k steps, 7.86B tokens:

| | sigmoid (control) | tanh_exact (treatment) | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Avg | 50.10 | 47.90 | **−2.20pp** |
| WikiPPL | 36.48 | 39.90 | **+3.42** |
| flex-avg | 2.12 | 2.05 | −0.07 |

The fix was supposed to make φ' a faithful derivative of φ. Instead the model trained a worse representation. Two confounded changes:
  (a) φ shape switched from `F.gelu` (exact erf-based) to tanh-approx GELU
  (b) φ' magnitude doubled (legacy was uniformly half the true gelu')

**Default unchanged: keep `gelu_grad_method: sigmoid`.**

**Next A/B (cheap, isolates hypothesis (b))**: keep `phi = F.gelu` and compute `phi' = 0.5·(1 + erf(x/√2)) + x·exp(−x²/2)/√(2π)` (analytic exact derivative of `F.gelu`). One extra erf+exp vs current; still sub-millisecond per layer at our scale. Add a third `gelu_grad_method` value: `"erf_exact"`. Run h1_boltz_fullsize_erfexact and compare to both sigmoid and tanh_exact.

Hypothesis to test: if `erf_exact` beats `tanh_exact` and matches `sigmoid`, the issue is the φ-shape change (F.gelu shape matters). If `erf_exact` ≈ `tanh_exact` (both worse than sigmoid), the legacy half-magnitude φ' was acting as beneficial gradient damping and we shouldn't "fix" it.

Old plan below preserved for reference:

### A/B test: tanh_exact φ' (HIGH PRIORITY, cheap)

The legacy code uses `φ' ≈ sigmoid(c·x) · 0.5` paired with `φ = F.gelu(x)` —
but this `φ'` is uniformly **half** the true `gelu'(x)`, and is not actually
the derivative of `F.gelu`. Term2 in `∂E/∂h` is therefore systematically
under-magnitude; weight scales partially absorb this during training, but
it's still a non-faithful gradient.

**Fix landed (gated, default = old)**: `BoltzmannMoE_Energy_MLP` now takes
`gelu_grad_method ∈ {"sigmoid", "tanh_exact"}` (default `"sigmoid"` for
backward compat). Setting `tanh_exact` switches both φ and φ' to the
self-consistent tanh-approx-GELU pair:
  φ(x) = 0.5 · x · (1 + tanh(c·x))
  φ'(x) = 0.5 · (1 + tanh(c·x)) + 0.5 · c · x · (1 − tanh²(c·x))
with c = √(2/π). One extra elementwise mul vs current.

**A/B plan** (run two h1_boltz_fullsize variants from scratch, 30k steps,
4 GPUs preemptable — ~6 h each):
  1. h1_boltz_fullsize_sigmoid (control; current default)
  2. h1_boltz_fullsize_tanhexact (treatment; `gelu_grad_method: tanh_exact`)
Otherwise identical configs. Compare avg / WikiPPL / GSM8k flex-avg.

Hypothesis: if phi' magnitude was being absorbed by W2 scale, we expect
small net effect on quality (≤ ±0.3pp avg). If the *shape* matters
(GELU' has a peak around x≈0.6 that sigmoid·0.5 misses), expect a
meaningful improvement on representation quality. Either way, **the
correct gradient should be the new default once we have data**.

If tanh_exact ≥ sigmoid: switch default to `tanh_exact` for new training,
keep `sigmoid` available for legacy checkpoint reproducibility.

Test (already run): `experiments/boltzmann-moe/tests/test_gelu_grad_method.py`
verifies (1) backward-compat (sigmoid path bit-identical to legacy),
(2) tanh_exact φ' matches autograd, (3) the two paths produce different
outputs on the same weights. Run via bsub when iterating on the model.

### MoE hyperparam search (queued for later)
Goals: find the best Boltzmann MoE config at h1 scale (145M, d=768, K=4, K=8, K=16)
**without** consuming so many GPUs at once that we get deprioritized in the queue.

Submit at most 3–4 jobs at a time; let them complete before the next batch.

Axes to sweep (in priority order):
- **Sparsity**: `top_k` ∈ {2, 3, 4} of K=4; {2, 4, 8} of K=8; {2, 4, 8, 16} of K=16
  — most promising follow-up: top-3 of 4 may close most of the 1.5pp acc gap
  while preserving sparse-train benefits ([[project_sparse_boltz_perf]]).
- **Temperature τ**: {0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0}. Higher τ softens routing distribution
  → less drastic truncation → smaller flex-acc gap for sparse top-k.
- **Repulsion λ**: {0.0, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0}. B4/B5 already showed 0.1 is good
  load balance; 0.3+ untested with new routing scale.
- **Number of experts K**: {4, 8, 16, 32} at h1 scale. Bigger K + smaller per-expert
  gives sparse a clearer FLOPs win (44% saving at K=16, top_k=2 vs 25% at K=4).
- **Repulsion target**: cosine sim (current) vs L2 distance vs orthogonality
  loss on term1.
- **Anneal top_k**: train soft → gradually reduce top_k over training. Should
  recover both the soft-train gradient signal and the sparse-eval efficiency.

### Sparse Boltzmann MoE production kernel
- Implement scattermoe-style fused dispatch for top-k Boltzmann gradient terms.
  Per-expert PyTorch loop is correct but loses on backward at every K (see
  [[project_sparse_boltz_perf]]). Need this to make sparse routing a real
  training-FLOPs win, not just an inference-FLOPs win.
- Or: try `torch._grouped_mm` (CUDA 12+) as an easier first step.

### Better integration of routing diagnostics into wandb
- Per-layer `effective_n_experts`, `n_dominant_experts`, `max_expert_load` are
  already logged. Add a heatmap visualization or per-step routing-entropy
  histogram for easier spotting of collapse runs.

### Larger scale Boltzmann MoE
- 580M continues; results @ 14k & 18k are encouraging. Plan:
  - 1.5B Boltzmann MoE (K=8, d=2048) at 65B+ tokens once 580M finishes
  - Try repulsion λ scaling with K: λ ∝ 1/K?

### Open questions
- Why does the soft-trained model lose 6 PPL when truncated to top-2 at eval?
  Hint: sparse-trained model doesn't pay this cost ([[project_sparse_boltz_perf]]).
  Hypothesis: the soft model's bottom-k experts contribute small-but-essential
  refinements during training; truncating at eval drops these. Test by
  measuring per-expert L2 norm of `term2_e * p_e` in trained vs sparse-trained.
- Is 580M's GSM8k_cot flex jitter (2.88% @ 14k → 2.27% @ 18k) within stderr
  (±0.4pp) or a real regression? Run cot eval at step 22k, 26k to see trend.
