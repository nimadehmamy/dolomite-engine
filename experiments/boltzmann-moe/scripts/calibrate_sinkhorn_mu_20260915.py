"""Post-hoc calibration of the running Sinkhorn dual mu for an ALREADY-TRAINED checkpoint.

WHY. mu is a batch statistic solved under no_grad and, before 2026-09-15, applied only when
self.training. So a model trained with mu-tilted routing was EVALUATED with mu = 0 -- a
train/test shift in the router. Measured cost on two otherwise-identical pure-energy isoP
arms: the clamped `load_balance_bias` (a persistent buffer with no self.training gate, so it
DOES reach eval) scored Avg11 41.49, while its Sinkhorn twin, whose mu was dropped, scored
36.16.

This recovers the existing checkpoints WITHOUT retraining, exactly as one recalibrates
BatchNorm running statistics: run a few hundred forward batches with Sinkhorn active,
accumulate the EMA into the `sinkhorn_mu` buffer, and save a new checkpoint directory whose
config sets `sinkhorn_persist_mu: true` so eval applies it.

DATA. Calibration uses the TRAINING corpus, not the eval sets: mu is part of the trained
routing rule, so estimating it on wikitext or the Avg11 tasks would be tuning the router on
the test distribution. Documents are taken from the TAIL of the megatron index, which is the
validation side of the run's own 99.5/0.5/0 split.

The original unsharded/ directory is never modified; output goes to a sibling directory.

KNOWN LIMITATION for RECURRENT / pure-energy stacks. The MoE block is shared across
iterations (layer_iterations [8] for a pure arm, [1,1,1,1,1,1,6] for a hybrid), so a single
forward pass solves a DISTINCT mu at each iteration -- the hidden states differ -- while there
is only ONE `sinkhorn_mu` buffer. The running mean therefore collapses those per-iteration
duals into one compromise value, and eval applies that same value at every iteration. Strictly
better than mu = 0, but NOT what training did. Watch for it in the `count` line: 64 batches on
an 8-iteration arm reports count=512, i.e. 8 solves per batch.
If recovery is only partial, this is the first thing to suspect, and the fix would be a
per-iteration buffer (the block would need to know its iteration index, which it currently
does not).
