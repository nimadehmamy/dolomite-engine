        # node with 33 other job slots and step time went 2.5s -> 6.8s at step 410, i.e. a 2.7x
        # slowdown turning a 42h run into 114h. The repo's own working 24-GPU launcher pairs
        # -x with num=8/task for precisely this reason.
        # PREFER A QUIET NODE INSTEAD OF DEMANDING AN EXCLUSIVE ONE (2026-09-14).

        # satisfied: 663 hosts", leaving both 32B arms PEND. But the contention that tripled our
        # step time is a LOAD problem, not an exclusivity one -- we landed on a host with 33 job
        # slots in use, while the median across hosts with 8 free GPUs is 1 and 416 such hosts
        # have <= 4. So select on CPU utilisation instead: it avoids the busy tail without
        # requiring the whole node, and 416 candidates schedule immediately where 0 did with -x.
        # RESERVE CPU SLOTS, not just a quiet node (2026-09-14). select[ut<0.5] only filters at
        # DISPATCH: our hosts were at 1 slot when chosen and drifted to 9 and 5, and step time
        # went 2.35 -> 6.05 s again. The underlying problem is that -n <nnodes> requests ONE slot
        # per host for EIGHT GPUs, so we are cgroup-limited to about one core and the dataloader
        # starves as soon as neighbours arrive. The repo's working 8-GPU-per-node launcher dodges
        # this with -x, which cannot be scheduled here, so reserve cores explicitly instead:
        # 16 of each host's 96 slots. That is graduated where -x is all-or-nothing.
        # REVERTED the 16-slot reservation (2026-09-14). It does not schedule: asking one host for
        # 16 slots AND 8 GPUs left the headline 32B arm PEND with "ngpus_physical not satisfied"
        # while a slower-but-running job had been killed to make way for it. Running beats optimal.
        # Contention remains a real risk (2.35 -> 6.05 s/step when neighbours arrive) but a job at

        # max_resubmits (400 for preemptable arms). An arm that dies in UNDER 5 min therefore
        # produced a fresh job every single cycle -- and because a run with no checkpoint yet
        # starts a NEW wandb run each time, one crash loop shows up as a flood of short runs
        # in wandb. That is what the user saw. It also masked the real problem: gptmoe_all_isoP

        #
        # Now: if a job died having lived less than MIN_ALIVE seconds, count it as a FAST
        # failure. Three consecutive fast failures pause the arm and log loudly, because a job
        # that cannot survive five minutes has a bug that resubmitting will not fix. Any run

        # ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        # NAME-BASED SAFETY CHECK (2026-09-14). Never resubmit an arm that is already
        # in the queue under its own name, whatever the state file says.
        #
        # WHY. The jid recorded in watchdog_state.txt is the only liveness signal, and it
        # is lost whenever the state file is missing, stale, or the watchdog restarts
        # before persisting it. The watchdog has restarted six times today; on two cycles
        # it read `last_jid=` empty for scale32B_boltz_hop and scale32B_gptswitch, decided
        # they were dead, and resubmitted them -- which put us over quota and got the
        # ALREADY-RUNNING job killed (TERM_OWNER) at step 660. On a 61,035-step run with
        # 1000-step checkpoints, each such cycle throws away everything since the last save.
        #
        # bjobs by name is authoritative and costs one call. If a RUN/PEND job with this
        # name exists, adopt its jid into the state file and skip the resubmit entirely.
        # 2026-09-15: SSUSP/USUSP/PSUSP ADDED. They were missing, and on the preemptable
        # queue that is a live duplicate-submission bug: LSF preempts by SUSPENDING

        # SSUSP -> PEND, i.e. it is then REQUEUED and loses its allocation (it does NOT

        # save_interval must be 1000 on this queue). PEND was already accepted below; the
        # hole was the SSUSP window itself, during which the job is alive, still holds its
        # jid, and must NOT be duplicated. So a preempted arm
        # plus a stale/missing state line => "dead" => a DUPLICATE submitted onto the same
