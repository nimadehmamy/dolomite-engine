# THE training submitter. Use this instead of hand-rolling a bsub -- hand-rolling is how
# 2026-09-16 lost two attempts:
#   * `-gpu "num=16/task" -n 1` asked for 16 GPUs ON ONE HOST. Hosts here have 8, so LSF said
#     "There are no suitable hosts for the job" and it PENDed forever. 16 GPUs means
#     2 nodes x 8, i.e. `-n 2 -gpu num=8/task -R span[ptile=1]` plus blaunch.
#   * submitting to normal/grp_ebm while grp_ebm was 32/32, which PENDs indefinitely.
#     `blimits`, NOT `bjobs`, is the authoritative quota check.
#
#   bash scripts/bsub/submit_train.sh <name> <config.yml> <gpus> [queue] [wall] [mem] [gpus_per_node]
#
#     queue:         "preemptable" (default) or "ebm" -> normal/grp_ebm
#     gpus_per_node: force the node shape. Default picks 8/node when gpus divides by 8.
#                    Use it when 8/node will not SCHEDULE: two hosts with 8 free GPUs each is far
#                    harder to place than one (a 2x8 probe sat PEND 1.5 h with "requirements for
#                    reserving resource (ngpus_physical) not satisfied: 236 hosts"), so `... 8
#                    preemptable 01:00 192G 4` gives 2 nodes x 4 and still exercises the
#                    multi-node collective + compile path.
#
# Examples:
#   bash scripts/bsub/submit_train.sh t32B_sandwich_sparse configs/tok32B/t32B_sandwich_sparse.yml 8 ebm
#   bash scripts/bsub/submit_train.sh t32B_pure_it4_sparse  configs/tok32B/t32B_pure_it4_sparse.yml  8
#
# WHAT IT ENCODES (all of it learned the hard way -- see watchdog_loop.sh for the full history):
#   * nnodes/gpus_per_node: >=8 and divisible by 8 -> 8 per node; else 4 per node.
#   * multi-node adds `-R span[ptile=1]` and runs pretrain.sh under `blaunch`. Single node must
#     NOT set a launcher: the inner script already says `bash`, and launcher="bash" produced
#     `bash bash pretrain.sh` -> "cannot execute binary file", a 13x crash loop.
#   * NO -x. It asks for the whole node and is unobtainable here ("requirement for exclusive
#     execution not satisfied: 663 hosts"), which left both 32B arms PEND. mode=exclusive_process
#     already gives the GPUs exclusively.
#   * select[ut<0.5] when taking 8 GPUs/node: we once landed on a host with 33 busy slots and
#     step time went 2.5 -> 6.8 s (a 42 h run becoming 114 h). This filters the busy tail at
#     dispatch. It does NOT prevent neighbours arriving later (measured 2.35 -> 6.05 s), but
#     reserving slots instead does not schedule at all, and a slow job beats an undispatchable one.
#   * BAD_HOSTS exclusion (p4-r10-n4: NVLink/NVSwitch fabric faults, error 401).
#   * load_args resolved AT RUN TIME, so every LSF requeue re-evaluates it. Deciding at submit
#     time is why t90k_pure_T12 restarted from step 0 twice, losing 2670 steps each time.
#
# AFTER SUBMITTING: verify at 30-60 s that STAT is RUN, that a first step appeared, and that
# tokens/step is what you intended -- GPUS IS NOT IN THE CONFIG, so a config written for 8 GPUs
# run on 4 silently trains on half the tokens (pre-flight 2/3).

# >99% of a run. The absolute saving is ~0.4 s/step in BOTH regimes, which is the expected signature
# (gradient all-reduce volume is independent of sparsity at stage 0, so a constant comms saving is a
# larger share of a shorter step). RDMA removes ~62% of the inter-node overhead.

# 2026-09-18 because 2 of 4 launches died at the first collective with IBV_WC_RETRY_EXC_ERR. But
# scale32B_boltz_sinkhorn had run 2 nodes x 8 GPUs for 58,260 clean steps on 2026-09-16, already at
# stage 0, and the justification conflated that LOUD ncclRemoteError with a SILENT stall at step 0,
# which is a different bug (the weight-space repulsion wedge). Three IB arms ran clean on 2026-09-23
# with zero genuine errors, INCLUDING one with all ten rails unrestricted, so the original fault
# looks transient or specific to the hosts drawn that day, not a broken fabric.
#
# FALLBACK: FORCE_TCP=1 puts a job back on TCP over IPoIB/bond1. Use it if a job dies at the FIRST
# collective with ncclRemoteError / IBV_WC_RETRY_EXC_ERR on repeated resubmits. A single such failure
# is worth one resubmit first (the watchdog resubmits anyway); only make it persistent if it recurs.
# ALLOW_IB=0 is accepted as a synonym. NOTE: a SILENT stall at step 0 with ZERO NCCL errors is NOT
# this -- that is the weight-space repulsion wedge, and FORCE_TCP will not fix it.
