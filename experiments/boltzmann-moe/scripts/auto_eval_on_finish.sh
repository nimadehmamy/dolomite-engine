# Submit a full eval for every cmix arm that has FINISHED, and only then.
#
# EDGE-TRIGGERED, not level-triggered. The old collect_flops_wave eval mode resubmitted the
# same eval on every cycle because it only checked "is there a checkpoint"; its own comments
# record that. Here an arm's part is skipped unless ALL of:
#   latest_checkpointed_iteration == num_training_steps   (the run is actually done)
#   that part's results file is absent                    (not already evaluated)
#   no live bsub job for that part                        (not already queued/running)
# so it is safe to run on a short cron.
#
# SPLIT INTO TWO JOBS (2026-09-18). gsm8k_cot generation is ~55-85 min of a >1.5 h 14-task
# eval, and on preemptable the whole job kept dying inside it: ev_cmix_134M_pure lost 51 min
# (792/1319 requests) and then another ~90 min on the retry. Now:
#   ev_<arm>    13 likelihood tasks + wikitext -> <sp>/unsharded_step<N>/harness_results_*.json
#   evg_<arm>   gsm8k_cot ALONE                -> <sp>/gsm8k_step<N>/gsm8k_raw_*.json
# A preemption now costs one task, not the whole eval. Each job runs merge_eval_results.py at
# the end; whichever finishes last writes harness_results_merged_*.json next to the
# likelihood results, because compute_avg11.py selects ONE newest file and does not union.
#
# The gsm8k raw file is deliberately NOT named harness_results_*.json: compute_avg11.py globs
# recursively from the run dir, so a gsm8k-only file with that name could be selected and read
# as a complete eval missing 11 of 14 tasks.
#
# Arms evaluated BEFORE the split already have gsm8k_cot inside their single json; the planner
# detects that and does not queue a redundant gsm8k job for them.
