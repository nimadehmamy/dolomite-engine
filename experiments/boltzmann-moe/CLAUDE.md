# Boltzmann MoE — Experiment Guide

> ## 📁 CONFIGS GO IN `configs/iclr_26/` UNTIL THE DEADLINE (end of Sep 25, 2026)
>
> **User instruction, 2026-09-24.** All experiment configs — including FineWeb-Edu sweeps,
> ablations, scaling runs — go into `configs/iclr_26/` (subdirectories are fine, e.g.
> `configs/iclr_26/fwe_sweep/`). Do NOT create top-level config directories. This keeps
> everything findable in one tree until the deadline passes.


> ## ⚠ DATA NAMING: "fineweb" configs train on nemotron-cc, NOT FineWeb-Edu
>
> **All configs in `configs/iclr_26/fwe_sweep/` named `fineweb_*` actually train on
> `web-nemotron-cc-hq-p2_0`** (granite-4 corpus, single web shard, 10.4B tokens).
> FineWeb-Edu was the plan but its .idx format was incompatible (LLMB variant, patched
> 2026-09-25). The names are historical. See `configs/iclr_26/DATA_NOTE.md` for details.
> Comparisons within the sweep are valid (same data for all arms).

> ## 🗄 THE RESCUED DATASET COPY IS A BIASED PREFIX — never compare loss across copies
>
> **Measured 2026-09-22 (HANDOFF §23).** `/proj/dmfexp/datasets-shared/granite-4-cmix-subset/` holds
> **complete** copies of `megamath-web-pro_0` and `finemath-3plus-rewritten_0` but only an
> **18.6% byte PREFIX** of `web-nemotron-cc-hq-p2_0/1` (50B of 268.7B tokens each).
>
> **That prefix is ~0.47 nats EASIER than the rest of the corpus** — 2.8702 vs 3.3213 and 2.7031 vs
> 3.1836 mean token NLL, scored by a full-corpus-trained checkpoint on documents inside vs beyond the
> span, consistent across both shards. Nothing in the dataset tree documents an ordering; the
> measurement is the only evidence (`scripts/test_subset_prefix_bias_20260922.py`).
>
> **So a subset-trained arm's loss CANNOT be compared with a full-corpus arm's.** This already
> produced a false reading: the 8B knob arms end at `train-lm_loss` 2.33 while the 32B cmix arms end
> at 2.6544 — same model, same mixture weights, both fully decayed — which looked like the 8B arms
> rivalling the 400M Switch (2.4095). A 134M model cannot beat itself with 4x fewer tokens. The bias
> predicts 0.70 x 0.47 x 0.85 ≈ 0.28 nats against the 0.32 observed, i.e. all of it. Comparisons
> *within* the knob sweep are valid; all six share the subset.
>
> **USE `/proj/dmfexp/datasets-shared/granite-4-cmix-FULL/` — an INDEPENDENT FULL-CORPUS COPY, made
> and validated 2026-09-23.** 2.28 TB of real blocks, not hard links, on a DIFFERENT fileset
> (`dmfexp`) from the owners' data, so it survives both an `rm` and a purge of the `datasets`
> fileset. Validated end to end, not just by size: token counts read from each `.idx` match the
> source exactly (`p2_0` 268,717,261,507, `p2_1` 267,862,755,688, `megamath` 13,011,272,317,
> `finemath` 21,118,698,552 = **570.7B tokens**), bytes/token 4.00, first and last document of each
> shard decode, and a 40-step 2-GPU training smoke test ran clean with the trainer reporting
> `Tokens per epoch: 265485990821` for `p2_1` (99% of the full shard; the subset prefix would report
> ~50B). Script: `scripts/validate_full_corpus_20260923.sh`.
>
> The files are **mode 444 and the directory is not group-writable** — deliberately, so no one can
> truncate them in place. Readable by everyone in POSIX group `proj_dmfexp` (verified for bsaha3,
> mau, bharat, csabath; **rpanda is NOT in that group** and cannot read it). LSF `grp_ebm` is an LSF
> group and has nothing to do with file access.
>
> A group-writable SHARED Megatron blend cache sits at
> `/proj/dmfexp/datasets-shared/.cache_megatron_cmix_FULL`, so the first person to run pays the index
> build and everyone after reuses it. Still use a FRESH cache if you change the mix or the paths —
> the blend index is keyed on both.
>
> **Ready-to-copy config: `configs/RECOMMENDED_400M_hybrid_best.yml`** (already points here).
>
> **Copying 2.28 TB takes ~5 minutes, not 6 hours.** The first attempt ran at 106 MiB/s because the
> script wrapped `cp` in `ionice -c2 -n7`, the LOWEST I/O priority, as a single stream with the
> default block size. `scripts/copy_corpus_fast_20260923.sh` does one `dd bs=64M` stream per file in
> parallel with NO `ionice` and hits ~7.2 GB/s aggregate (3.2 GB/s single-stream). It writes to
> `.part` and renames only on an exact byte-size match, so it is safely resumable.
>
> `/proj/datasets/ndehmamy-dataset-rescue/` (hard links, `links=2`, `dev=54`) is now a BACKUP of last
> resort rather than the primary. Its limits are why the independent copy was made: a hard link
> defends against `rm` only, not against in-place truncation (both names share one set of blocks),
> and it sits in the same `datasets` fileset as the owners' path, so a fileset purge takes both.
>
> **NEVER pair indices across directories.** `full-corpus-indices/*.idx` + subset `.bin` reads past
> EOF; subset `.idx` + full `.bin` silently trains on the first 18.6% only. Neither necessarily
> errors. Also: a full-corpus directory cannot be assembled under `/proj/dmfexp/` by hard-linking —
> `/proj/datasets` and `/proj/dmfexp` are different filesystems, `ln` fails per-file, and you are
> left with indices and no data, which is exactly the mispairing above.

> ## 💾 TOKEN MILESTONES: VERIFY HOURLY THAT THE MACHINERY IS ALIVE. LOSS IS PERMANENT.
>
> **User instruction, 2026-09-20: "it is very important to check that the milestone script is still
> running every hour."** A missed milestone CANNOT be recovered — `max_to_keep: 2` has already
> deleted the weights. On 2026-09-20 the 8B and 16B anchors of five arms were found gone, because
> the milestone cadence had been a **session-scoped `CronCreate` job that died silently with its
> session**. At `save_interval: 200` + `max_to_keep: 2`, a 400M checkpoint survives only ~400 steps
> ≈ **17 minutes**, so there is almost no margin.
>
> **Primary mechanism is now IN THE TRAINER** — `SaveArgs.token_milestones_b` (default
> `[8, 16, 24, 32]`) → `_preserve_token_milestones()` in `lm_engine/checkpointing/__init__.py`, which
> runs in the same save call that wrote the checkpoint, BEFORE pruning. It uses the EXACT
> tokens/step (`WORLD_SIZE x mbs x ga x seq`) and captures the first checkpoint at or after each
> crossing, so it cannot race pruning and needs no tolerance heuristic. Hard links cost no extra
> space until pruning would have removed the original.
>
> **Backstop** is `scripts/milestone_ckpt_backup.sh`, now invoked every cycle by
> `watchdog/watchdog_loop.sh` — which SELF-RESUBMITS and therefore outlives any session. It is a
> bridge for arms already running from before the in-trainer change; drop it once every live arm has
> restarted.
>
> **Hourly check — all three must hold:**
> ```bash
> bjobs -J boltz_moe_watchdog                       # must be RUN
> tail -5 experiments/boltzmann-moe/scripts/watchdog/watchdog.log
> find experiments/boltzmann-moe/results -type d -name "tok*B_step*_actual*" | wc -l
> ```
>
> **NEVER trust a milestone directory's NAME.** Until 2026-09-20 the backup script picked the
> earliest *surviving* checkpoint at or after the target, so once an arm ran on it hard-linked
> `tok8B_step122000_actual31.98B` — a directory named for 8B holding **32B** weights. 15 such
> anchors existed and were renamed to `orphan_*`. Always read the `_actualXX.XXB` suffix, and treat
> an anchor whose actual is more than a few percent off its nominal as invalid.

> ## 🚦 NEW CONFIGS: CONFIRM WITH THE USER **BEFORE** SUBMITTING. NO EXCEPTIONS.
>
> **User instruction, 2026-09-20.** For any NEW run config (not a plain resume of a config that has
> already been running), present these points to the user and get an explicit go-ahead **before**
> `bsub`. Do not submit first and verify after.
>
> 1. **DATAMIX — is it the `configs/cmix/` mix, WITH the math sets?** The correct block is
>    `0.35 web-nemotron-cc-hq-p2_0` + `0.35 ..._p2_1` + **`0.15 megamath-web-pro_0`** +
>    **`0.15 finemath-3plus-rewritten_0`**, `split: 99,0.5,0.5`, and
>    `data_cache_path: /proj/dmfexp/nima/.cache/megatron_cmix`. Our older configs are 100% web /
>    0% math and are NOT comparable on any task. Prove it, do not assume:
>    `diff <(sed -n '/^datasets:/,/^tokenizer_args:/p' configs/cmix/cmix_134M_hybrid_32B_sparse.yml) <(sed -n '/^datasets:/,/^tokenizer_args:/p' NEW.yml)`
>    must be EMPTY.
> 2. **DID YOU COPY THE RIGHT PARENT?** Name the parent config explicitly and diff against it with
>    pre-flight rule 10, accounting for EVERY line.
> 3. **LAYER STRUCTURE AND RECURRENCE.** State `num_layers`, the full `layer_iterations` list, the
>    per-block `sequence_mixer_type` and `mlp_type`, and the structural name (`6G1x6E` etc.).
>    `1x6E` = ONE block applied SIX times; six distinct blocks is a different model.
> 4. **Token budget and GPU count** — `GPUS x mbs x ga x seq`, and GPUS IS NOT IN THE CONFIG.
> 5. **Params**: `energy_ff_paramcount.audit_config` TOTAL / ACTIVE / FLOPwt against the arm it
>    will be compared with, and say which of the three are matched and which are not.
> 6. **PER-EXPERT WIDTH — added 2026-09-23 after `abl_P` was lost to it.** `intermediate_size` is the
>    TOTAL across experts, so print `I_e = intermediate_size / n_experts` and `I_e / hidden_size` for
>    every mixture block and compare with the arm you will judge against. `abl_P_134M_pure_223_isoall`
>    passed point 5 at 0.11% on all three totals and still trained worse than every other arm at every
>    step, because three distinct MoE blocks sharing one block's parameter budget put `I_e` at **96-144
>    (0.09-0.13x hidden)** against the hybrid's 1024 (1.33x) and the pure arm's 4480 (5.83x). This
>    file's own B-series note already says "experts too small -- fails" and "do not scale the iso-param
>    design". **Totals matching to 0.1% is exactly what shrinking the experts buys you, so point 5
>    cannot catch this.** Treat `I_e / hidden < ~0.5` as dead on arrival unless that IS the experiment.
>
> Report those five, wait, then submit. A wrong datamix or a wrong `layer_iterations` is not
> recoverable — it is a wasted multi-day run against a deadline.

> ## ⏱ WATCH EVERY RUN: 1 MIN x 10, THEN 5 MIN FOR THE FIRST HOUR, THEN 30 MIN
>
> **User instruction, 2026-09-20 (revised).** After ANY submission (new run OR resume):
> **every minute for the first 10 minutes, then every 5 minutes until the run is 1 hour old,
> then every 30 minutes.** The 5-minute band exists because arms have died at 15-40 minutes
> in -- past the first-10-minute window but long before a 30-minute check would notice.
>
> **THE STEP LINES GO TO STDERR, NOT STDOUT.** `$HOME/bsub_logs/<job>_<id>.stderr` carries
> `step = N, train-loss = ...`; stdout holds only the launcher echo, `ninja:` and the NCCL banner.
> Grepping stdout shows nothing and **looks exactly like a silent hang** — this wasted a
> diagnosis on 2026-09-20 when three healthy 400M/1B arms were read as wedged at NCCL init.
>
> ```bash
> tail -3 $HOME/bsub_logs/<name>_<jobid>.stderr        # step lines live HERE
> ```
>
> **🔴 CHECK FOR A CPU FALLBACK FIRST — IT IS SILENT AND BURNS THE WHOLE WALLTIME.** Caught
> 2026-09-20 on `abl_E` (job 1796776, host `p2-r03-n1`): CUDA init failed on the host, and the
> trainer **did not abort** — it built `DeviceMesh((pp=1, ddp=4, fsdp=1, tp=1), 'cpu', ...)` and
> proceeded to train a 134M model ON CPU. LSF showed `RUN`, 2848 s of CPU time and 69.5 GB
> resident, and **zero steps in 20 minutes**, which is indistinguishable from a slow compile.
> It would have held 4 GPUs for 24 h and produced nothing. This is the same host-level
> `CUDA unknown error` documented in §14.2a, but reached WITHOUT any suspension.
>
> ```bash
> e=$HOME/bsub_logs/<name>_<jobid>.stderr
> grep -m1 "DeviceMesh" $e        # must NOT say 'cpu'
> grep -c "CUDA unknown error\|No CUDA runtime is found" $e   # must be 0
> ```
>
> If it says `'cpu'`: `bkill` and resubmit with `SUSPECT_HOSTS="<host>"` to avoid re-drawing that
> host (`bjobs -o exec_host <jobid>` names it). Promotion to `BAD_HOSTS` needs TWO faults on the
> same host; one fault goes to `SUSPECT_HOSTS` for the retry only.
>
> What else to confirm in the first 10 minutes: `STAT=RUN`; a first `step =` line appeared; the step
> number CONTINUED FROM THE CHECKPOINT (not 0 — a missing `load_args` silently restarts from
> scratch); and tokens/step is what you intended
> (`billion_tokens_per_day * 1e9 * step_time / 86400`). After that, every 30 min: the step counter
> is still advancing and the arm is still `RUN`.
>
> **A FROZEN STEP COUNTER IS NOT NECESSARILY A HANG — CHECK CPU TIME BEFORE KILLING ANYTHING.**
> `abl_E` (job 1798097) sat at step 4,080 for 9 minutes with `STAT=RUN` on 2026-09-20, which is the
> documented wedge signature, and nearly got killed. It had actually been REQUEUED by LSF: the new
> process resumed from `global_step4000`, so the step counter went BACKWARDS (4,080 -> 4,010) and
> then climbed again. Distinguishing the two takes one command:
>
> ```bash
> bjobs -l <jobid> | tr -d '\n' | grep -oE "CPU time used is [^;]*|MEM: [^;]*"
> grep -c 'Setting OMP_NUM_THREADS' $HOME/bsub_logs/<name>_<jobid>.stderr   # >1 = restarted
> ```
>
> **⚠ USE STDERR MTIME AS THE PRIMARY SIGNAL, NOT THE CPU DELTA.** LSF samples
> `CPU time used` COARSELY, so a 20-30 s window can report a delta of ZERO on a perfectly healthy
> job. Measured 2026-09-20: `abl_F` showed `CPU 21564 -> 21564` over 25 s while it was actively
> logging step 34,550 — a false wedge verdict that would have killed a healthy arm. The wedged
> `abl_G` had a **34-minute-stale stderr**; healthy arms are 0-1 min. So:
>
> ```bash
> e=$HOME/bsub_logs/<name>_<jobid>.stderr
> echo $(( ($(date +%s) - $(stat -c %Y "$e")) / 60 )) min stale    # 0-2 = healthy, >10 = suspect
> ```
>
> * **HEALTHY**: stderr mtime within a couple of minutes, step number advancing over a 10-min window.
> * **RESTART**: the step number JUMPS BACK to the last checkpoint, CPU time is small and rising from
>   ~0, memory climbing from ~2 GB, and the stderr holds more than one `Setting OMP_NUM_THREADS`
>   banner. Nothing to do — it is resuming and loses only the steps since the last save.
> * **HANG**: stderr stale for MANY minutes, step number unchanged over that whole span, one process
>   banner, and CPU time flat when sampled over minutes (not seconds). That is the case to kill —
>   with `bkill -r`, see below.
>
> Killing a requeued-but-healthy job throws away whatever it has redone since the checkpoint, and if
> its first checkpoint has not been written yet it restarts from ZERO — that is how `abl_E` lost
> 1,770 steps earlier the same day.
>
> **A WEDGED JOB IGNORES `bkill` — USE `bkill -r`.** On 2026-09-20 the hung `abl_G` (job 1798098)
> was sent a plain `bkill`, which printed `Job <1798098> is being terminated` and did NOTHING: a
> process stuck inside a compiled region does not service SIGTERM. It stayed `RUN` for 20 more
> minutes holding 8 GPUs, and because its 4-GPU replacement targeted the same `grp_ebm` quota, the
> corpse blocked its own replacement from ever scheduling. `bkill -r` (force, bypasses the
> application) killed it instantly. **After killing a wedged job, VERIFY it left the queue** —
> `bjobs <jobid>` must say EXIT or be empty — and never assume a kill succeeded because LSF
> acknowledged the request.
>
> `STAT=RUN` IS NOT PROGRESS. Five arms were found dead on 2026-09-20 and a sixth
> (`abl_B_400M_6G1x6S`) stayed dead through the first sweep because it was not in
> `scripts/health_check_arms.py`'s list. The authoritative progress source is
> `<save_path>/latest_checkpointed_iteration.json`, not `bjobs`.

> ## 📕 READ `HANDOFF.md` FIRST — IT IS THE RUNNING RECORD, AND IT CONTRADICTS OLDER CLAIMS
>
> **`experiments/boltzmann-moe/HANDOFF.md` is the authoritative log of what has actually been
> measured.** It is long, so read the LAST numbered section first and work backwards; each section
> is dated and later ones supersede earlier ones. This file (CLAUDE.md) carries the standing rules;
> HANDOFF carries the findings, including the ones that overturn results quoted further down here.
>
> **As of section 15 (2026-09-20, later) the newest items are:** "sparse" is TWO mechanisms —
> **sparse(proxy)** (rank-r subspace router, hopfield only) and **sparse(surrogate)** (KL-distilled
> MLP head that nominates candidates, the only option for w1w2) — and the grid CANNOT separate them
> from the expert form, because every hopfield arm is proxy and every w1w2 arm is surrogate (§15.1);
> the first w1w2 number is **Avg11 44.16** against hopfield's 44.82 while using ~46% MORE compute,
> and it is NOT a clean expert-form test (§15.1); three SILENT failure modes, including a trainer
> that falls back to a **CPU DeviceMesh** and trains nothing while LSF says RUN (§15.2); and six
> arms dead at once with no watchdog coverage (§15.3). Run priorities now live in
> **`configs/iclr_26/priority.md`**.
>
> **As of section 14 (2026-09-20), the three things most likely to be misquoted:**
> 1. **The Switch baseline `6G1S` is under-provisioned by 12.9% of FLOPs** — it applies its MoE block
>    once where the energy block is applied six times. The FLOP-matched `6G1x6S` scores **45.43 Avg11
>    against the energy hybrid's 44.82**, so at iso-FLOP the learned gate LEADS by 0.61pp. Report
>    competitive-but-behind, NEVER parity. (§14.1)
> 2. **Every hand-computed parameter total in this project was LOW** — a swiglu MLP's `c_fc` is
>    `2*intermediate_size`, so a dense swiglu block costs `3*d*I`; and `energy_attention` is `2*d*d`,
>    not `4*d*d`. Use `energy_ff_paramcount.audit_config`, which matches a meta build to the byte.
>    The claim that the 400M sandwich is iso-FLOP with the baseline is **RETRACTED**. (§14.7)
> 3. **The 134M "sandwich" was MISLABELLED** — `5G1x6E1G` is the hybrid with the energy block one
>    position earlier, not a thin-bread/thick-core sandwich. Block PLACEMENT costs 1.37pp, more than
>    the routing mechanism's 0.05pp. The true `1G1x6E1G` was only built on 2026-09-20. (§14.1)
>
> Two operational rules earned the hard way: **never `bstop` a pending GPU job** (it invalidates
> `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and every parked eval dies on resume), and **an inherited `mbs`/`ga` written
> for 8 GPUs gives HALF budget at 4 GPUs** — gate on budget, schedule, structure AND build before
> launching, not on build alone. (§14.2)

> ## ✍️ "EDIT DIRECTLY" / "EDIT DRAFT" = PULL, EDIT, PUSH TO OVERLEAF
>
> **User instruction, 2026-09-23.** When the user says **"edit directly"** or **"edit draft"**, do
> not paste LaTeX into the chat for them to copy. Run the whole round trip so they can review the
> rendered result on Overleaf:
>
> ```bash
> cd ~/Code/overleaf/boltzmann-moe-ICLR-2026

> git add -A sec/ && git commit && git push origin main

>
> `origin` is the Overleaf git bridge and `main` is the only branch; pushing there IS how the user
> sees the change, so the usual "never push to main" caution does not apply to this repo. Tell them
> the commit hash when done.
>
> **Four things that have already gone wrong doing this:**
> 1. **`git pull` first, every time.** The user edits in the Overleaf UI, which commits as
>    `Update on Overleaf.`; skipping the pull turns a 10-second edit into a merge.
> 2. **Back up `sec/` before any mechanical rename** (`cp -r sec /tmp/sec_backup_$(date +%s)`) and
>    diff against it afterwards. A regex with an optional-brace group
>    (`S_\{?([ikB])\}?`) silently ATE the closing brace of `$e^{-\beta S_k}$` on 6 lines, producing
>    `$e^{-\beta E_k$`. `pdflatex` cannot run in this environment, so LaTeX breakage is only
>    discovered on Overleaf. **Verify brace balance per file against the backup.**
> 3. **Check a new symbol is not already a substring of an existing macro.** `m_i` looked free but
>    is the tail of every `\sum_i`, so any future `sed` on `m_i` would corrupt them. `a_i` was
>    genuinely free. Grep the ORIGINAL before choosing.
> 4. **Assert each replacement matches exactly once** before writing. Prose identities change
>    meaning under a rename: `$s_k = -S_k = +E_k$` became the circular `$a_k = -E_k = +a_k$` and
>    had to be rewritten by hand, not by pattern.
>
> **SIGN CONVENTION (unified 2026-09-23, commit `ad60056`).** The draft used to carry THREE symbols
> for one quantity up to sign -- `E_k` (overlap, non-negative), `S_k = -E_k` (state energy), and
> `s_k` (routing logit, `= +E_k`) -- which is how the routing-sign bug survived review. Now two:
>
> | symbol | meaning | invariant |
> |---|---|---|
> | `E_x` | **always an energy** | every Boltzmann weight is `e^{-\beta E}` |
> | `a_x` | the **overlap**, `E_x = -a_x` | **APPENDIX ONLY** (it is what the code stores); the body uses `E` alone |
>
> `s_k` is gone. **Before pushing any change that touches a sign, re-run the invariant check:**
> ```bash
> grep -rcoE 'S_\{?[ikB]\}?' sec/*.tex          # must be 0 everywhere
> grep -rnoE 'softmax[^)]{0,34}' sec/theory.tex  # every argument: -\beta E or \beta a
> ```

> ## ✏️ PAPER STYLE: NO EM DASHES `---` IN LATEX. RESTRUCTURE, DO NOT SUBSTITUTE.

> preference:
>
> 1. **Restructure the sentence.** Start a new sentence, or use commas, or parentheses. This is
>    what the user actually wants: "just change your style". An em dash is usually a sign that two

> 2. **En dash `--`** only as a fallback, where restructuring would damage someone else's prose.

> Applied in `sec/{intro,related,app_related,theory}.tex` as of 2026-09-23. **Still outstanding:

>
> Count them with `grep -c -- '---' sec/*.tex`. Note the `--` before the pattern, or `grep` reads

> **User instruction, 2026-09-23.** The ICLR main body must fit 8-9 pages, so computation and
> experiment detail belongs in the appendix, not the body.
>
> **Structure as of 2026-09-23:** `sec/related.tex` is a SHORT two-paragraph section after the
> intro; the long version lives in **`sec/app_related.tex`** (`\label{app:related}`), wired into
> `main.tex` immediately after `\appendix` and BEFORE `\input{sec/appendix}`. Keep that split when
> adding related work: one or two sentences in the body, the full account in `app_related`.
>
> `sec/intro.tex` ends with a **`\paragraph{Contributions.}` itemize**. Prose cut from the intro is
> PARKED VERBATIM in `sec/outtakes.tex` rather than deleted, because its `\CC{}` notes record
> measurements and retractions that exist nowhere else. `outtakes.tex` and `debug.tex` are both
> `\input` by `main.tex` and must BOTH be removed before submission.

> ## 🔴 TWO 2026-09-15 FINDINGS THAT INVALIDATE EARLIER CONCLUSIONS — READ BEFORE TRUSTING ANY ROUTING OR s/step CLAIM
>
> **1. The composable Boltzmann router is SIGN-INVERTED.**
> `ROUTING_SIGN_BUG_20260915.md`. Measured on a trained checkpoint: the router selects
> the experts with the **LOWEST** `||gelu(W_k x)||^2` — 0.62x the average expert's
> overlap, exactly the lowest-overlap set. `_HopfieldExpert` stores an energy that
> GROWS with overlap and `e_sign="neg"` then picks the smallest. The legacy
> `BoltzmannMoE_Energy_MLP` does it correctly (`E = +overlap`, `softmax(+E/tau)`).
> Affects **every `EnergyFF_BoltzmannMoE` run**: the whole 22-arm ICLR grid and the
> live 400M. NOT the learned-gate/Switch arms, not gptswitch, not the legacy
> `h1_*`/`b*`/`c*` series.
> Correcting it (`e_sign_override: "pos"`) revives the FF branch **20–100x**
> (`ffwd/output_norm` 0.03 → 12) and **collapses routing** (effK 8.5 → 1.9 of 32),
> because anti-routing was acting as an accidental load balancer. So TWO paper claims
> are affected: "the energy-FF branch is essentially dead" (caused by the bug) and
> "Boltzmann routing does not collapse and needs no load-balancing loss" (may hold
> only because of it). A third — "energy routing is at parity with a learned gate" —
> was measured under the inverted sign. **Do not restate the routing-health results.**
> Note: across 300 steps the sign made NO resolvable `lm_loss` difference
> (+0.006..+0.013 vs a 0.038 noise floor), which is why it went unnoticed.
>
> **2. The "~5x slower than gptswitch" figure is substantially a HOST-PLACEMENT artifact.**
> `PLACEMENT_ARTIFACT_20260915.md`. Same unfused code, same config, resumed from the
> same checkpoint on a different host pair: **6.72–6.81 → 2.45–2.53 s/step**, i.e.
> 2.7x from placement alone. Identical GPU model/driver/`gpu_factor`, no MIG; sibling
> contention ruled out (median 6.739 before gptswitch finished vs 6.784 after).
> Likely dataloader starvation from shared CPU slots — per-rank GPU-busy is 1.71 s, so
> 25% utilisation at 6.76 s wall vs 68% at 2.49 s. **Consequences:** the real ratio to
> gptswitch is ~1.9x (still not placement-controlled), and the "launch-overhead bound /
> 79.5k kernels" reading is largely void at 68% utilisation.
> **Rule: no multi-node s/step claim is admissible unless placement-controlled** —
> same hosts for both arms, or several placements with the spread reported.
>
>
> **3. The balance property has a PRINCIPLED replacement, and Sinkhorn beats what we ship.**
> `ROUTING_SIGN_BUG_20260915.md`, `HANDOFF.md` §11.3-11.6. Load balancing is the
> **chemical potential** `p_k ∝ exp((E_k - mu_k)/tau)` — the dual variable of the
> batch-marginal constraint, with no gradient pathway and no learned gate, so the "no
> auxiliary loss" claim survives it. `balance_rate` (proportional control) pinned at the
> +-1.0 clamp in every arm; **`sinkhorn_iters` solves the dual exactly** and at 134M
> reaches `effK` **26.6/32** against the shipped arm's **5.0** (max_share 0.072 vs
> **0.353** — the shipped config has one expert taking 35% of tokens), with the best
> loss and best expert diversity of the three, at `mu = 3.44` i.e. 3.4x past the clamp.
> Trends: shipped balance **degrades** (effK 19.9 -> 5.7), both corrected+balanced arms
> **improve**.
> **Energy stability:** the feared runaway does NOT happen — the energy is evaluated on
> RMSNorm'd `ln_x`, and the SHIPPED inverted arm carries 2.5-3x MORE energy (0.59 peak)
> than either corrected arm. No activation change warranted.
> **Do not draw conclusions from these probes before ~200 steps** — a step-30 reading of
> the tau sweep gave the wrong answer and had to be retracted.
>
> Acceleration work: `ACCEL_FINDINGS_20260915.md`. `fused_experts` is EXACT (1.227e-15)
> and 1.61x at 4 GPU / 1 node.
>
> **CORRECTED 2026-09-23 — `fused_experts` is NOT single-node-only.** ACCEL_FINDINGS' "WEDGES at
> 16 GPU / 2 nodes ... validated single-node only" was superseded by HANDOFF §13.3, which measured
> `fused_experts` + `sparse_forward` + **output**-space repulsion running a 120-step 2-node probe at
> 1.44 s/step. **The wedge is `fused_experts` + `repulsion_space: weight`**, because
> `_add_repulsion_loss_weight` reshapes a dim-0-sharded DTensor BY EXPERT, which crosses shard
> boundaries and issues an inter-node collective from inside a dynamo graph. It is silent: zero NCCL
> errors, zero steps. So the rule is **`repulsion_space: output` + `repulsion_subsample: 64` for
> anything multi-node**, and `fused_experts` stays on.
>
> Leaving the stale claim here had a cost: HANDOFF §19.9 cited it as the blocker for the 1B all-MoE
> pair and recommended `fused_experts: false`, which would have forfeited the fusion speedup for no
> reason. **`fused_experts: false` is not a free choice anyway** — `sparse_forward` asserts on it
> ("sparse_forward is built on the fused-weight view"), and `proxy_rank > 0` asserts on it too
> (the looped path never runs the proxy, so the proxy would silently never be trained). Turning
> fusion off turns the entire sparsity mechanism off.
>
> **Multi-node is also ~50% flaky at STARTUP**, separately: a LOUD `ncclRemoteError` at the first
> collective, before training. And this cluster's InfiniBand fails the first inter-node RDMA
> (`IBV_WC_RETRY_EXC_ERR` across 6+ HCAs, 7+ peers, 4 host pairs), so `submit_train.sh` exports
> `NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1` for every multi-node job — inter-node traffic goes over TCP. Arms launched
> without it sat dead at step 0. Do not hand-roll a multi-node bsub.

> ## ⚡ TRUE SPARSITY — measured 2026-09-16. Read before quoting any sparsity or FLOPs number.
>
> `HANDOFF.md` §12.9 has the full tables. The three things that get misquoted:
>
> **1. `sparse_forward` is the one that works: 4.69x** (compiled, forward+backward, H100) on the
> pure_T12 block shape at its real per-call size. That is **past the `1/2*(1+k/K)` "cannot beat 2x"
> floor**, which applies only to an exact router — the rank-r proxy is what breaks it.
> `sparse_backproj` alone is 1.18-1.35x and is redundant with it.
>
> **2. THE SPEEDUP DEPENDS ON tokens/call AND THE SIGN FLIPS.** At 4096 tokens/call
> `sparse_forward` LOSES on hybrid shapes (0.41-0.49x compiled); at 16384 it wins 2.1-2.4x.
> Dispatch overhead is O(T*k) regardless of `I_e`; the saving is O(T*(K-k)*I_e). **Never quote a
> sparsity speedup without the per-call token count** — `micro_batch_size x sequence_length`, NOT
> tokens/step. The 400M hybrid at `micro_batch_size: 1` sits in the losing column.
>
> **3. The proxy's prediction error is the ENTIRE approximation.** With an oracle proxy the sparse
> path reproduces the dense output to 4e-16 with the selection free
> (`scripts/test_sparse_forward_20260916.py`). So there is nothing to audit in the dispatch — audit
> the proxy. `renormalize_topk: true` and `routing_norm: none|sqrt_width` remove the two smaller
> approximations by config rather than by code.
>
> Training a sparse arm needs a DENSE phase first: the proxy is distilled against the exact all-K
> routing distribution, which the sparse path does not compute. Fit post-hoc on a trained
> checkpoint with `scripts/calibrate_proxy_router_20260916.py`.

> ## 📥 EVAL JOBS GO TO `preemptable`, NOT `normal`/`grp_ebm` — DEFAULT, DO NOT REVERT
>
> `grp_ebm` is a **32-GPU allocation and is routinely at 32/32** (a colleague's 16 plus our own
> 400M arm's 16). Every eval submitted to `normal`/`grp_ebm` therefore **PENDS INDEFINITELY**:
> found 2026-09-16 with `ev_slope90k_hyb_sink` and `ev_iclr_big_hop_sandwich_sink` stuck 2 and 4
> hours respectively. Moved to `preemptable` with `bmod -q preemptable -G grp_preemptable`, they
> both went `RUN` **immediately**.
>
> Evals are short and restartable, and `grp_preemptable` sits around 500-700 of 6144, so the trade
> is a small preemption risk against never starting at all. Changed in
> `scripts/collect_flops_wave_20260912.sh` (the driver the babysitter actually calls — it is
> invoked fresh each cycle, so no restart is needed), plus `auto_eval_babysitter.sh` and
> `auto_followup_20260912.sh`. **Keep it that way unless `grp_ebm` is genuinely free.**
>
> Two related traps. `blimits`, not `bjobs`, is the authoritative quota check. And a job's
> `from_host` tells you WHO submitted it: both stuck evals showed `p5-r16-n3`, which is where
> `boltz_auto_eval` runs — that is how the automation was identified as the source.
> `scripts/submit_surrogate_router_b5.sh` still targets `normal`; it is a legacy TRAINING
> submitter, not an eval, and was left alone deliberately.

> ## 🖥 ANY GPU WORK GOES THROUGH bsub — INCLUDING ONE-OFF TESTS AND BENCHMARKS
>
> **An interactive session is frequently on a CPU-ONLY compute node.** Verified 2026-09-16 on
> `p2-r05-n3`: `hostname` says compute node, and `nvidia-smi` says **"No devices were found"**.
> So "I am on a compute node, I can run directly" is only true for CPU work. A GPU script run
> in-shell there either dies or silently falls back to CPU — and a *timing* script that falls
> back to CPU returns numbers that look plausible and are meaningless.
>
> **Submit every GPU test.** Use the saved wrappers rather than hand-rolling a bsub each time:
>
> | script | use |
> |---|---|
> | **`scripts/bsub/submit_train.sh <name> <cfg> <gpus> [queue] [wall] [mem]`** | **ANY training run. Handles the node shape.** |
> | `scripts/bsub/submit_selfresuming.sh <name> <cfg> <gpus> [wall] [mem]` | older single-node-only variant (preemptable) |
> | `scripts/bsub/submit_gpu_test.sh <job> "<cmd>" [gpus] [wall] [mem]` | generic one-off GPU test/benchmark |
> | `scripts/bsub/bench_sparse.sh` | the exact sparsity wall-clock sweep behind §12.9 |
>
> **NEVER hand-roll a training bsub.** Two failures on 2026-09-16 alone:
> `-gpu "num=16/task" -n 1` asks for 16 GPUs ON ONE HOST, and hosts here have 8 — LSF answers
> "There are no suitable hosts for the job" and the job PENDs forever. 16 GPUs means **2 nodes x 8**:
> `-n 2 -gpu num=8/task -R span[ptile=1]` plus `blaunch`. And submitting to `normal`/`grp_ebm` while
> it sits at 32/32 pends indefinitely — check with `blimits`, NOT `bjobs`.
> `submit_train.sh` encodes the node shape, the ptile/blaunch rules, the `ut<0.5` host filter, the
> BAD_HOSTS exclusion, and run-time `load_args` resolution. Pass `ebm` as the queue for
> normal/grp_ebm; the default is preemptable.
>
> ```bash
> bash scripts/bsub/submit_gpu_test.sh mytest \
>     "python experiments/boltzmann-moe/scripts/test_something.py --train"
> ```
>
> **`preemptable` is the right queue for tests** (`-q preemptable` REQUIRES `-G grp_preemptable`).
> Tests are short, a preempted one costs only a resubmit, and `grp_ebm` is capacity-limited —
> check it with `blimits`, NOT `bjobs`. Logs go to `$HOME/bsub_logs/`, never `$HOME`.
> Then verify 30–60 s later: `bjobs -J <job>` must show `RUN`, not `EXIT`.
>
> Only these stay safe to run in-shell: file edits, `git`, `ls`/`find`/`grep`,
> `bsub`/`bjobs`/`bkill`, LaTeX, and CPU-only Python (a float64 exactness test on tiny tensors is
> fine — a timing run is not).

> ## 🛑 CONFIG PRE-FLIGHT — RUN THIS BEFORE ANY LONG RUN. NO EXCEPTIONS.
>
> Every buggy long run in this project came from a config that *looked* right. A week of
> deadline does not buy time to re-run; it makes each wasted run unaffordable. Before launching
> anything longer than ~1 h, verify EVERY line below against the config as parsed, not as
> written, and against the arm it will be compared with.
>
> **1. Schedule covers the run.** `num_warmup_steps + num_constant_steps + num_decay_steps`
> MUST equal `num_training_steps`. The `slope90k_*` arms set 2000+28000=30000 against 90000, so
> **60000 steps ran pinned at the 2e-4 floor** and bought 0.015–0.019 nats across 45–51k steps.
> This bug is in the PUBLISHED configs, so it corrupts a paper claim, not just a rerun.
>
> **2. Tokens/step matches the arm you will compare against.**
> `tokens/step = GPUS × micro_batch_size × gradient_accumulation_steps × sequence_length`.
> GPUS is NOT in the config — it comes from the launcher (watchdog conf field 5, or the bsub
> `-gpu num=N/task` × tasks). `iclr_big_hop_pure_sink` was registered at 4 GPUs while its
> published counterpart ran at 8, so the rerun saw **half the tokens** and its delta was
> read as a sign effect when it was an undertraining effect.
> **Two figures for that delta are in circulation and they are NOT in conflict** — they use
> different corrected checkpoints against the same published inverted arm (Avg11 **40.02**):
> `unsharded` scores **39.04** (**−0.98pp**, before the §12.1 mu recalibration) and
> `unsharded_mucal2` scores **39.43** (**−0.59pp**, after it). **Quote −0.59pp.** Either way the
> cause is the token mismatch, not the routing sign.
> Verify empirically, not from the config:
> `tokens/step = billion_tokens_per_day × 1e9 × step_time / 86400` from the training log.
>
> **3. GPU count is what you think.** `nexec_host` is HOSTS, not GPUs. `bjobs -l` shows
> `num=8/task` and `gpus=0..7`; 2 hosts × 8 = 16. Do not infer 4/host.
>
> **4. `load_args` present iff resuming.** Absent ⇒ a restart silently begins at step 0 (LSF
> requeues a preempted job on the SAME jid, re-running the original command). Present but
> pointing at an empty dir ⇒ a fresh run fails. The watchdog appends it only when a checkpoint
> exists, which is correct; hand-written configs must match that.
>
> **5. `latest_checkpointed_iteration.json` names a directory that EXISTS.** With
> `max_to_keep: 2`, a from-scratch restart writes a LOW checkpoint, points at it, and pruning
> (which keeps the HIGHEST) deletes it — every subsequent start then dies instantly.
>
> **6. Names and paths are unique.** A distinct `save_path` AND wandb `name` per arm. Beware
> **prefix collisions** when globbing logs or results: `foo_*` matches `foo_sink_*` and
> `foo_s7_*`. Anchor on the numeric job id (`foo_\d+\.stderr`). This produced two wrong
> numbers in one session, both plausible-looking rather than erroring.
>
> **7. Knobs reach the model, not just the YAML.** `get_mlp_block` forwards kwargs EXPLICITLY,
> so a field can parse onto the pydantic args object and never reach the builder. Verify by
> RESOLVING: `build_boltzmann_moe(**kw).moe.e_sign` — and note `e_sign` lives on `.moe`, not on
> the `FusedMoEContainer` the builder returns, so a probe reading the container gets `None` for
> everything and its fallback branch will report whatever you told it to.
>
> **8. The sign is direction-dependent per expert kind.** hopfield needs
> `e_sign_override: "pos"`; composable w1w2 needs `"neg"`. A blanket `"pos"` is a silent no-op
> on w1w2.
>
> **9. Required for Sinkhorn arms:** `sinkhorn_persist_mu: true` and
> `sinkhorn_mu_iters` = this block's `layer_iterations` entry. Without them the router is
> trained tilted and EVALUATED untilted: **+1.587 nats at 8 iterations, +1.827 at 12**, ~0.003
> for a hybrid. Also `repulsion_tensor_idx: true`, and NO `cos_probe_interval`.
>
> **10. Diff against the arm you are copying.** `diff <(grep -vE '^\s*#|^\s*$' old.yml)
> <(grep -vE '^\s*#|^\s*$' new.yml)` and account for EVERY line. Unexplained differences are
> bugs; expected-but-absent differences are also bugs.
>
> Then, 30–60 s after launch, confirm the arm reached a first step and that its logged
> `learning_rate` and tokens/step are the intended values.

> ## 📊 DATAMIX REFERENCE — `configs/cmix/REFERENCE_s8e4_stdmoe_fh2_boltz_topk2.yml`
>
> **That vendored file is THE reference for the datamix.** It is the colleagues'
> `s8e4_stdmoe_fh2_boltz_topk2.yml` (`Bharat-Runwal/dolomite-engine`, branch
> `bsaha/boltzmoe-iclr27`), copied in verbatim on 2026-09-17. Any new run that needs to be
> comparable to a colleague's number takes its `datasets:` block from there, not from our
> older configs.

> | `split` | `99,0.5,0.5` | `99.5,0.5,0` |
>
> **70% web / 30% math against our 100% web / 0% math.** Expect this to move MMLU and
> GSM8K-CoT most, but it is not confined to those — treat EVERY cross-group comparison as
> confounded until the mix is matched. Both math sets are present on disk
> (`megamath-web-pro_0` 52 GB, `finemath-3plus-rewritten_0` 79 GB ≈ 13B and 21B tokens), so
> 0.15 × 32B = 4.8B each stays under one epoch.
>
> Use a **separate `data_cache_path`** (`/proj/dmfexp/nima/.cache/megatron_cmix`) — the

>
> **Datamix-controlled arms live in `configs/cmix/`:**
> - `cmix_134M_recur.yml`, `cmix_400M_pure_it4_sparse.yml`, `cmix_400M_sandwich_sparse.yml`
>   — byte-identical to their `projab_dual_unconstrained` / `t32B_*` parents EXCEPT the
>   datamix and the run names (verified: 0 diff lines outside those). Our recurrence,

> **Three traps in the upstream file, all corrected in our port:**

> 2. Its header states its whole purpose is `energy_scale_mode: sqrt_inv_d` "instead of a
>    learnable temperature" — but **the body never sets `energy_scale_mode`** and does set
>    `temperature: 1.0`, and the field does not exist in our tree either. So the file is not
>    what its header claims. Worth raising with them: any "fixed sqrt(1/d) beats learnable T"
>    conclusion may rest on a config that never enabled it.
> 3. Hopfield stores **one** matrix per expert where legacy w1w2 stores two, so at their
>    `intermediate_size: 76288` the port is **~793M, not the ~1105M** of the upstream file.
>    Restoring 1.1B is either 2× `I_e` (19072) or 2× experts (K=16); K=16 is what our own
>    results favour, but expert count was left at their 8 for the first port.
>
> **`repulsion_space` differs by scale, deliberately.** The `cmix_400M_*` arms inherit

> ## 🔒 RUN CONSISTENCY FOR THE PAPER — ISO-TOKEN, AND GPU COUNT IS RECORDED, NOT REMEMBERED
>
> **Every paper arm trains on exactly 32.0B tokens on the `configs/cmix/` datamix.** Decided
> 2026-09-17 after an audit found the whole 134M tier at **7.9B** (a quarter of budget) and
> `cmix_134M_gptswitch` at **23.6B** — i.e. the baseline had 3x the tokens of the arms it was
> being compared against. That single defect inverted two reported conclusions:
> at 90000 steps gptswitch looked competitive (Avg11 43.82) and looked *better* on wiki ppl
> (40.58 vs 44.54); re-evaluated at its **step-30000** checkpoint for a matched 7.9B it scores
> **42.31** with ppl **55.45** — so hybrid actually leads by **+2.46pp** and wins on perplexity
> too. Never compare arms without checking the budget first.
>
> **`tokens/step = GPUS x micro_batch_size x gradient_accumulation_steps x sequence_length`, and
> GPUS IS NOT IN THE CONFIG.** It comes from the launcher, so a config alone cannot tell you what
> a run trained on. Three mechanisms now close that hole — use them instead of reasoning:
>
> 1. **wandb run config** (`lm_engine/pretrain.py`): every run logs `world_size`,
>    `gpus_per_node`, `num_nodes`, `micro_batch_size`, `gradient_accumulation_steps`,
>    `sequence_length`, `tokens_per_step`, `total_tokens`, `launch_cmd`, `lsf_job_id`,
>    `lsf_hosts` into the run config, so they are sortable run columns and each run
>    self-documents its own budget.
> 2. **Launch ledger** (`experiments/boltzmann-moe/logs/launch_ledger.tsv`), written by
>    `scripts/bsub/submit_train.sh` on every submission: utc, jobid, name, config, **gpus /
>    nodes / gpus_per_node**, queue, wall, mem, mbs, ga, seq, steps, **tokens_per_step**,
>    **total_tokens**, git commit, config sha256, and the exact command line. The resolved
>    config is snapshotted to `logs/launch_configs/<name>_<jobid>.yml`.
> 3. **`scripts/report_cmix_evals.py`** prints Avg11 / MMLU / GSM8K(flex AND strict) / wiki-ppl
>    per arm, resolves GPU count from the ledger or EMPIRICALLY from the log
>    (`billion_tokens_per_day * 1e9 * step_time / 86400`), and **refuses to assume** — it prints
>    `NOT ISO-TOKEN` with the budget groups whenever arms disagree.
>
> **Do not hand-assemble a results table.** A dropped cell once reported wiki-ppl 40.58 as a
> GSM8K score, and `flexible or strict` silently reported strict-match because a genuine `0.0`
> flexible score is falsy in Python. Both are fixed in `report_cmix_evals.py`; run it.
>
> **The 32B reruns are `configs/cmix/cmix_134M_*_32B.yml`** — 122070 steps x 262144 tok/step,
> mbs 4 / ga 2, **LAUNCH AT EXACTLY 8 GPUs**. They are RERUNS, not resumes: the 30000-step arms
> completed their cosine decay to the LR floor, so extending the schedule and resuming would
> re-raise the LR mid-run. The 7.9B numbers remain valid as a shorter-budget datapoint.
>
> **Eval harness:** the colleague's checkout is `experiments/eval_scripts/lm-evaluation-harness`
> (`lm_eval 0.4.9.2`); site-packages has **0.4.11**. For our tasks the definitions are
> scoring-identical — every diff is a `dataset_path` rename (`openai/gsm8k` vs `gsm8k`) — and

## What is BoltzmannMoE?

Each of the 12 EGPT blocks gets a new FFN type where the energy is the
log-partition function over K parallel experts:

```
E_moe(h) = log( Σᵢ exp(Eᵢ(h)) )
∂E_moe/∂h = Σᵢ pᵢ(h) · ∂Eᵢ/∂h      pᵢ = softmax_i(E(h) / τ)
```

Each expert is an Energy\_MLP: `Eᵢ(h) = φ(W1ᵢh)ᵀ(W2ᵢh)`.
The routing energy is `Eᵢ = h · term1ᵢ` where `term1ᵢ = φ(W1ᵢh) @ W2ᵢᵀ`
(contracting only the first gradient term; the full gradient would add a
spurious Hessian contribution).

**Iso-parameter**: K experts each of size `intermediate_size // K` → same total
params and FLOPs as one Energy\_MLP with the same `intermediate_size`.

## Key source files

**Two lineages** — the B/C/H-series and all `h1_*` checkpoints use the *legacy*
class; every `math_fet_*` / `EnergyFF_*` checkpoint uses the *composable* refactor
(2026-06-28). See `HANDOFF.md` §3 for how to tell them apart and why it matters.

| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `.../mlp_blocks/mlp.py:540` | **legacy** `BoltzmannMoE_Energy_MLP` (w1w2 experts) |
| `.../mlp_blocks/energy_ff.py` | **composable** family: `FFEnergyBase`, `W1W2FFEnergy`, `HopfieldFFEnergy`, `BoltzmannMoEFFEnergy`, `FusedMoEContainer`, `build_boltzmann_moe` |
| `lm_engine/hf_models/config/mlp.py` | `_BoltzmannMoEEnergyMLPArgs` (legacy) and `_EnergyFFBoltzmannMoEArgs` (composable) |
| `.../mlp_blocks/__init__.py:113` / `:179` | `get_mlp_block` dispatch — legacy / composable |
| `lm_engine/hf_models/config/__init__.py` | Registry entry (`_MLP_CONFIG_CLASSES`) |
| `lm_engine/train_utils.py:73` | `get_metrics()` logging for routing collapse metrics |
| `lm_engine/arguments.py` | `SaveArgs.max_to_keep: int | None` (pydantic fix) |
| `.../sequence_mixer_blocks/energy_attention.py:75` | `head_dim` (optional; decouples from `d/num_heads` for over-complete heads) |

## Config fields for `BoltzmannMoE_Energy_MLP`

```yaml
mlp_blocks:
  - mlp_type: BoltzmannMoE_Energy_MLP
    intermediate_size: 16384   # total = n_experts × per_expert_I
    n_experts: 16              # number of experts
    temperature: 1.0           # Boltzmann softmax temperature
    repulsion_coef: 0.0        # 0 = off; 0.01–0.1 = stochastic contrastive repulsion
    n_repulsion_pairs: 4       # random expert pairs sampled per step for repulsion
    dropout: 0.0               # dropout on intermediate activations
    add_bias: false
```

**IMPORTANT**: always set `max_to_keep: 2` in `save_args` — the field is
`int | None` and pydantic will reject `null` from saved checkpoint configs
without this fix.

```yaml
save_args:
  save_path: ...
  save_interval: 5000
  max_to_keep: 2
```

## Experiment configs

All located in `configs/boltzmann_moe/`.

### B-series (deep EGPT, iso-param, d=768):

| Config | repulsion_coef | dropout | weight_decay | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| `b1_boltz_moe_16x1024_d768_lr2e3.yml` | 0 | 0 | 0.1 | Baseline — does routing collapse? |
| `b2_boltz_moe_repulsion_16x1024_d768_lr2e3.yml` | 0.01 | 0 | 0.1 | Weak repulsion |
| `b3_boltz_moe_dropout_wd_16x1024_d768_lr2e3.yml` | 0.01 | 0.1 | 0.3 | Dropout + high WD |
| `b4_boltz_moe_repulsion_strong_16x1024_d768_lr2e3.yml` | 0.1 | 0 | 0.1 | Strong repulsion (best load balance) |
| `b5_boltz_moe_rep_strong_dropout_wd_16x1024_d768_lr2e3.yml` | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.3 | Combined |

All use: `d=768`, 12 blocks, 16 experts × 1024 = **~422M total params**. Note: all B variants (original iso-param code) underperform V1 EGPT d=768 (143M) due to the 21:1 FFN:Attn imbalance — but see the revised results at the bottom: the 1/√I routing-scale fix lifts the B4 rerun to 0.494 (≈ V1-400M EGPT).

### C-series (design fixes, d=768):

| Config | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `c1_topk_energy_moe_4x2048_top2_d768.yml` | 4 full-size experts, top-2 sparse, load-balance loss |
| `c2_surrogate_boltz_16x1024_d768.yml` | Boltzmann routing + learned linear surrogate router |
| `c3_attn_moe_2x_d768.yml` | MoE on **attention** (2 energy-attn experts), normal FFN |
| `c4_paired_unit_moe_2x_d768.yml` | 2 paired (attn+FFN) units, balanced FFN:Attn |

### H-series (hybrid GPT+EGPT-MoE, **best results**):

6 standard GPT layers + 1 recurrent EGPT block (×6). MoE only in the EGPT block.

| Config | Description | Avg acc | WikiPPL |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `h1_boltz_moe_fullsize` | **BEST**: Boltzmann routing, 4 full experts×2048 + 1/√I routing scale | **0.501** | **36.5** |
| `h1_topk_egpt_moe_d768.yml` | 4 full experts×2048, top-2 (learned router) | 0.499 | 39.8 |
| `h1_gptmoe_boltz_egpt` | Switch-MoE GPT prefix + Boltzmann EGPT (full-size) | 0.486 | 35.5 |
| `h1_boltz_topk2` | Sparse top-2 Boltzmann in EGPT (no learned router) | 0.486 | 36.4 |
| `h1_topk_egpt_moe_r128_d768.yml` | h1_topk + 128 register tokens | 0.484 | 39.6 |
| `h1_boltz_egpt_moe_d768.yml` | Boltzmann routing, **iso-param** (experts too small — fails) | 0.464 | 46.1 |

**Update (2026-06-05)**: With **full-size experts** (not iso-param split) **and
1/√(expert_I) routing-energy normalization**, Boltzmann routing (0.501) matches or
slightly beats learned-router top-k (0.499). See the revised conclusion below.

## Running experiments

### Submit a new training run

```bash
REPO=/proj/dmfexp/nima/Code/dolomite-engine
mkdir -p $HOME/bsub_logs

bsub \
    -q preemptable -G grp_preemptable \
    -J egpt_b1_boltz_moe \
    -gpu "num=4/task:mode=exclusive_process" \
    -n 1 -M 64G -W 06:00 \
    -o "$HOME/bsub_logs/egpt_b1_boltz_moe_%J.stdout" \
    -e "$HOME/bsub_logs/egpt_b1_boltz_moe_%J.stderr" \
    <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
source /proj/dmfexp/nima/Code/nanoGPT-og/.venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=/proj/dmfexp/nima/Code/dolomite-engine:${PYTHONPATH:-}
bash /proj/dmfexp/nima/Code/dolomite-engine/scripts/common/pretrain.sh \
    /proj/dmfexp/nima/Code/dolomite-engine/configs/boltzmann_moe/b1_boltz_moe_16x1024_d768_lr2e3.yml
EOF
```

Or use the convenience script:

```bash
cd /proj/dmfexp/nima/Code/dolomite-engine
bash experiments/energy-inference/scripts/multi-block-ablation/run_b1_b3_boltz_moe.sh
```

### Resume from checkpoint

The training script auto-detects `latest_checkpointed_iteration.json` and
resumes. For manual resume, append `load_args` to the config:

```bash
cat >> /tmp/resume_b1.yml <<'YAML'

load_args:
  load_path: /proj/dmfexp/nima/Code/dolomite-engine/experiments/boltzmann-moe/results/b1_boltz_moe_16x1024_d768_lr2e3
YAML
# then submit with /tmp/resume_b1.yml as the config
```

### Wall-time note

At ~0.91 s/step, 30k steps takes ~7.6 hours. Use `-W 08:00` for a single
uninterrupted run. If using `-W 04:00`, the job will checkpoint at 5k-step
intervals and need resubmission.

---

## Scaling up

To scale to more experts or larger hidden size, adjust `intermediate_size` and
`n_experts` in the config. The table below shows total params for d=768, 12 blocks:

| n_experts | per_expert_I | total_I | ~Total params |
|-----------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| 4 | 1024 | 4096 | ~165M |
| 8 | 1024 | 8192 | ~243M |
| 16 | 1024 | 16384 | ~422M (B-series) |
| 16 | 2048 | 32768 | ~723M |
| 32 | 1024 | 32768 | ~723M |

**Warning (applies to the B-series iso-param design only)**: the *deep iso-param*
B-series is severely FFN-heavy (FFN:Attn ≈ 21:1 at 422M), and there the V1 d=768 EGPT
baseline (143M, FFN:Attn ≈ 2.7:1) scored higher (0.481 vs 0.474). **This has since
been fixed — do not scale the iso-param design.** Use the H-series recipe instead:
a GPT prefix + one recurrent EGPT block whose MoE uses **full-size experts**
(int=2048 each; top-k or Boltzmann) with **1/√(expert_I) routing-energy
normalization**. That keeps FFN:Attn balanced, and once applied the Boltzmann MoE
matches/beats top-k and scales cleanly — a 679M model reaches 0.580 avg / 20.2 PPL at
53.5B tokens (see updated results below).

## Routing collapse metrics (WandB)

Logged every 10 steps under `model/energy_mlp/<block>.ffwd/`.

> **Caveat (fixed 2026-09-12)**: `train_utils.py:73` gated on the legacy classes
> only, so **no `EnergyFF_*` run ever logged these** — every `math_fet_*` wandb run
> has attention norms and nothing else. `FFEnergyBase` is now in the isinstance
> tuple, but runs completed before this date have no routing metrics to plot, and
> any claim about their routing collapse was inferred rather than measured.

| Metric | Range | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `effective_n_experts` | 1.0 → K | Per-token entropy exponentiated. **1.0 = hard routing** |
| `n_dominant_experts` | 1 → K | How many experts win argmax across the batch |
| `max_expert_load` | 0 → 1 | Fraction of tokens routed to the busiest expert (uniform = 1/K = 0.0625) |
| `mean_token_entropy_norm` | 0 → 1 | Normalized per-token routing entropy |

**Key finding**: `effective_n_experts ≈ 1` by step 500 for all variants (hard routing
emerges fast), but `n_dominant_experts = 14–16` — different tokens go to different
experts. This is **not** collapse to a single expert; it is learned specialization.
B4 (repulsion 0.1) achieves best load balance (`max_expert_load ≈ 0.37`).

---

## Expert specialization analysis

Routing vectors (per-sample, per-layer, per-expert) are cached in:

```
experiments/boltzmann-moe/results/routing_cache/routing_b{1-5}.pkl
```

Load format:
```python
import pickle
data = pickle.load(open("routing_b1.pkl", "rb"))
# data["categories"]["COPA"]["routing"]  → (N, 12, 16) float32
# data["categories"]["COPA"]["texts"]    → list of N input strings
```

Re-run deep analysis (PCA, Mahalanobis separation, routing profiles) without
re-running inference:

```bash
bsub -q normal -G grp_ebm -n 1 -M 8G -W 00:30 \
     -gpu "num=1" \
     -o $HOME/bsub_logs/pca_analysis_%J.stdout \
     -e $HOME/bsub_logs/pca_analysis_%J.stderr \
    <<'EOF'
source /proj/dmfexp/nima/Code/nanoGPT-og/.venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=/proj/dmfexp/nima/Code/dolomite-engine:${PYTHONPATH:-}
cd /proj/dmfexp/nima/Code/dolomite-engine
python experiments/energy-inference/scripts/multi-block-ablation/analyze_boltz_expert_deep_20260429.py \
    --model b1 --reuse --device cpu
EOF
```

To collect new routing data for a new model (needs GPU):

```bash
# Add to MODELS dict in analyze_boltz_expert_deep_20260429.py:
#   "b6": RESULTS / "b6_.../unsharded"
# Then submit with --model b6 (no --reuse flag)
```

| B1 rerun (1/√I fix) | 407M | 0.483 | 38.0 | was 0.474/51.9 |

**Conclusion (revised 2026-06-05)**: The earlier "MoE does not beat plain EGPT"
verdict was an artifact of two *fixable* B-series flaws — the iso-param design (tiny
experts, FFN:Attn ≈ 21:1) and an **unnormalized routing-energy scale** that caused
loss spikes. After (a) using **full-size experts** and (b) normalizing the routing
energy by `1/√(expert_I)`:

- Full-size **Boltzmann MoE (0.501 / 36.5)** ≥ learned-router **top-k (0.499 / 39.8)**
  at 145M, and both beat the iso-compute plain-EGPT baseline (0.489 / 39.6).
- The same fix rehabilitates the B-series: **B4-rerun 0.494 / 38.0** (was 0.466 / 51.9),
  now matching V1-400M EGPT (0.494 / 38.6).
- It scales: a 679M model reaches **0.580 avg / 20.2 PPL at 53.5B tokens**.

Net: **Boltzmann energy routing is competitive with, and slightly ahead of, top-k**
once experts are full-size and the routing scale is normalized. The energy
landscape selects experts without a learned router and generalizes to sparse top-2.
Full detail and the gelu_grad / h2 A/B studies are in `PROGRESS.md`.
