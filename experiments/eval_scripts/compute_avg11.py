"""compute_avg11.py — CANONICAL headline aggregator, consistent with colleagues.

This reproduces the **paper `tab:scaling` Avg11 recipe** used by the EGPT-RL /
FET series, so our numbers are directly comparable to theirs (no avg9/avg10 vs
avg11 apples-to-oranges — see the warning that used to live in the boltzmann-moe
CLAUDE.md).

Recipe (source of truth: ~/Code/GPT-experiments/projects/EGPT-RL/RESULTS.md:247-249):

    Avg11 = unweighted mean of ELEVEN tasks
        acc_norm : arc_challenge, arc_easy, hellaswag, openbookqa, piqa, sciq
        acc      : boolq, copa, winogrande, race, lambada_openai
    MMLU (acc) and GSM8K-CoT (flexible-extract) are reported SEPARATELY,
    NEVER folded into the average. WikiText word-PPL likewise separate.

How this differs from our old `compute_aggregates.py` avg10:
    - avg10 INCLUDED mmlu in the mean and EXCLUDED race + lambada_openai.
    - Avg11 EXCLUDES mmlu from the mean and INCLUDES race + lambada_openai.
    Net: drop mmlu, add race + lambada. Because race (~0.28) and lambada (~0.23)
    sit near chance at our scale, Avg11 runs ~3pp below the old avg10 — that gap
    is a scoring-convention artifact, not a model difference. Do NOT put avg10
    and Avg11 in the same table.

VALIDATION / PROVENANCE (2026-09-14): the recipe here (task list + metric-per-task)
matches the EGPT-RL colleague's exactly. On the numbers, be careful — there are
TWO distinct sets for the shared math_egptdual seeds, and an earlier draft of this
docstring conflated them (it claimed a +0.004pp reproduction of 49.35/49.67; that
claim was WRONG and has been removed):
  - The colleague's stored Avg11 (49.35 seed42, 49.67 seed1234) came from THEIR OWN
    complete-task eval (all 11 tasks incl. race+lambada). Those eval JSONs are NOT
    in this repo, so 49.35/49.67 are not reproducible here.
  - The in-repo step-dirs one naturally reaches for (seed42@16100, seed1234@16200)
    are 9/11 INCOMPLETE (race+lambada absent); this script correctly FLAGS them as
    "INCOMPLETE (9/11)" rather than averaging (their partial 9-task means are 53.14
    / 53.56 — NOT an Avg11, do not quote).
  - The COMPLETE final unsharded dirs for those seeds DO carry all 11 tasks and
    score, under this recipe, Avg11 = 51.88 (seed42) / 50.75 (seed1234). Those are
    the reproducible IN-REPO Avg11 values; use them for any in-repo cross-check.

Missing-task policy: if any of the 11 tasks is absent from the results file,
this script REFUSES to print a plain "Avg11". It prints "Avg11 INCOMPLETE (k/11)"
and names the missing tasks, so a partial average can never be mistaken for a
real one. (race + lambada_openai were unrunnable before the pyarrow>=20 fix of
2026-08-03; re-run those checkpoints if you see them flagged missing.)

Usage:
    python compute_avg11.py <harness_results.json | run_dir> [--json]

If given a directory, the latest harness_results_*.json in it (recursively) is
used, ignoring harness_bbh_results_*.json.
