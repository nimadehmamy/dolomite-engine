    KL-DISTILLED d->K head that REPLACES the energy router at eval
    (``energy_ff_surrogate.py``).

    A SUBCLASS of ``_EnergyFFBoltzmannMoEArgs`` so a surrogate arm keeps every expert /
    routing / Sinkhorn / sparsity knob of its no-surrogate twin, and so a new knob added there
    is automatically available here. It does NOT modify the parent: the ``mlp_type`` default is
    overridden and ``model_post_init`` re-states the parent's assertions (which pydantic does
    not inherit once overridden) plus the head's own.

    Defaults are the NO-OP: ``surrogate_coef: 0.0`` + ``use_surrogate: false`` makes the module
    bitwise identical to ``EnergyFF_BoltzmannMoE``, so this ``mlp_type`` is safe to put in a
    config before deciding to train the head.

    ``sparse_forward`` IS supported, but only via ``surrogate_replaces_proxy: true`` (2026-09-19):
    that path never calls ``_route``, so the head reaches it by BEING the module's cheap all-K
    router (it overrides ``_proxy_energies``). The head then NOMINATES p = ``sparse_candidates``
    experts and the EXACT energies of those p re-rank to the final ``top_k`` and set every
    weight -- it is a selector, never a gate. Without the flag ``sparse_forward`` is still
    refused, because the head would be computed and silently ignored. See section (d) of
