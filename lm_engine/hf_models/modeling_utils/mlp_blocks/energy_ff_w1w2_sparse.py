# Sparse Boltzmann-MoE for W1W2 (bilinear) energy experts — 2026-09-18
# **************************************************
"""True-sparsity path for ``expert_kind="w1w2"``, the second expert type.

``energy_ff.py`` implements ``sparse_forward`` (skip the forward AND back projection of the
K-k experts a token was not routed to) for **Hopfield experts only**; this module adds the
w1w2 line as a subclass. Everything here is either a subclass override or an import.

UPDATE 2026-09-19 — REACHABLE FROM YAML. Two things changed on that date:
  * ``energy_ff.py``'s ``assert fused_spec["kind"] == "hopfield"`` now accepts ``"w1w2"`` too,
    AND additionally requires that the instance actually overrode ``_forward_fused`` (which
    only this class and its surrogate subclass do). So the ``_KIND_SHIM`` that used to pass the
    literal ``"hopfield"`` with the real kind hidden under ``kind_real`` is GONE.
  * ``get_mlp_block`` routes ``mlp_type: EnergyFF_BoltzmannMoE`` with ``expert_kind: w1w2`` and
    ``fused_experts: true`` to ``build_boltzmann_moe_w1w2_sparse`` below. Before that, this
    module was dead code from a config's point of view.
Nothing else in ``energy_ff.py`` is modified: six long training runs import it.

===============================================================================================
IS THE EXTENSION MECHANICAL? MOSTLY YES, WITH ONE STEP THAT GENUINELY FAILS.
===============================================================================================

The hypothesis under test was "we just need to do the low-rank thing for two matrices instead
of one". Step by step against the 11 steps of the Hopfield path:

  MECHANICAL (algebra carries over verbatim, only the arity changes 1 -> 2):

  1. FUSED WEIGHT VIEW. ``_FusedW1W2Holder`` already keeps two ``(K*I_e, hidden)`` tensors and
     hands each expert a contiguous row-slice, exactly as ``_FusedHopfieldHolder`` does for one.
     Two ``.view(K, I_e, H)`` instead of one. Reused by import; no new holder class.
  2. CAPACITY DISPATCH. ``_dispatch_plan`` maps (token, expert) pairs to slots in a fixed
     ``(K, C, *)`` buffer and never looks at a weight. Reused verbatim.
  3. ONE GATHER, TWO PROJECTIONS. ``xbuf`` is gathered once; ``bmm`` against ``W1v`` and
     against ``W2v``. The token dispatch is shared, so the gather/scatter cost does NOT double.
  4. THE ENERGY IS STILL FREE. ``E = -I_e^-0.5 * (phi(W1x) . (W2x))`` needs both projections —
     and both are needed for the descent gradient anyway, so the energy of an evaluated expert
     still costs zero extra, which is the property the whole design rests on.
  5. BACK PROJECTION. ``phi @ W2 + (phi' * W2x) @ W1`` — two bmms against the same two views,
     same ``(se, slot)`` indices, one ``index_add_``.
  6. WEIGHTS / DENOMINATOR / RE-RANK / mu / zscore moments. All of it acts on ``(T, p)``
     energies and never on a weight, so ``_logits_raw``, ``_zscore_moments``, ``_mu_for``,
     ``_route``, ``_track_load``, ``_track_energy``, ``_proxy_step``, ``pop_load_metrics`` are
     reused unchanged. Sign handling included: w1w2 stores ``E = -overlap``, so the CORRECTED
     routing sign is ``e_sign="neg"`` (CLAUDE.md pre-flight check 8) — but that is a config
     value flowing through ``_logits_raw``, not a structural difference.
  7. COST MODEL. Dense ``4*K*d*I_e`` per token against sparse ``4*cf*k*d*I_e + proxy``: the
     ratio ``K/(cf*k)`` is IDENTICAL to Hopfield's. w1w2 pays 2x the FLOPs at equal ``I_e``
     but sparsity buys exactly the same factor.

  NOT MECHANICAL — THE ONE THAT FAILS:

  8. ``proxy_out_dim`` (the m-row subsample) IS STATISTICALLY VALID FOR HOPFIELD AND INVALID
     FOR W1W2, and this is not a detail: it is the knob that makes the proxy cheap enough for
     the sparse path to be worth running at all.

     Hopfield: ``E = mean_j gelu(z_j)^2`` — a mean of I_e NONNEGATIVE terms. The mean is
     O(term), so an m-row subsample has relative error ``(sigma/mu)/sqrt(m)`` with
     ``sigma/mu = O(1)``: ~4% at m=512. energy_ff.py's comment is right, for Hopfield.

     w1w2: ``E = -I_e^-0.5 * sum_j phi(u_j) v_j`` — a sum of I_e terms of RANDOM SIGN, because
     ``v = W2 x`` is sign-indeterminate. The sum is O(sqrt(I_e) * term), not O(I_e * term);
     that cancellation is exactly why this energy carries ``1/sqrt(I_e)`` where Hopfield
     carries ``1/I_e``. An m-subsample estimator ``(I_e/m) * sum_sub`` then has error
     ``~ sigma*I_e/sqrt(m)`` against a signal ``~ sigma*sqrt(I_e)``:

         relative error  ~  sqrt(I_e / m)        (w1w2)
         relative error  ~  1 / sqrt(m)          (Hopfield)

     At I_e=2240, m=512 that is ~2.1, i.e. 210% — the "estimate" is noise. MEASURED on CPU in
     ``experiments/boltzmann-moe/scripts/test_sparse_w1w2_20260918.py`` (TEST 8), which prints
     both curves side by side.

     CONSEQUENCE. For w1w2 the faithful subspace proxy is forced to ``m = I_e``, and at m=I_e
     the proxy does ``K*I_e`` elementwise work per token — which is MORE than the sparse
     mixture's own ``cf*k*I_e`` (6.4x more at K=16, k=2, cf=1.25). The proxy would then cost
     more than the thing it is there to make cheap. So the Hopfield recipe does not transfer,
     and ``proxy_out_dim < I_e`` here is a MODEL-CAPACITY choice that MUST be distilled, not an
     unbiased estimator you can read off an SVD. Both facts are asserted/logged below rather
     than left to be rediscovered.

  9. THE SVD WARM START HAS A CORRECTNESS TRAP THAT THE HOPFIELD CODE WALKS INTO IF COPIED.
     ``_svd_refit_proxy`` picks the m most energetic rows of ``U S`` PER MATRIX. The w1w2
     energy pairs coordinate j of ``W1 x`` with coordinate j of ``W2 x``. Choosing the top-m
     rows of W1 and, independently, the top-m rows of W2 pairs MISMATCHED coordinates and
     computes a quantity with no relation to the energy — silently, with no shape error. The
     row subset must be COMMON to both. Implemented that way below (scored by
     ``||B1_row|| * ||B2_row||``, a heuristic, flagged as such).

 10. OUTPUT-SPACE REPULSION CANNOT REUSE ``_add_repulsion_loss_fused``. That helper exploits
     ``expert_out = pref * (gated @ W)`` to back-project only the sampled experts from a single
     ``gated``. A w1w2 expert output is a SUM OF TWO back-projections against two different
     matrices, so there is no single ``(gated, W)`` pair. Handled by building the expert-OUTPUT
     stack for a token subsample and feeding the LOOPED helpers ``_add_repulsion_loss`` /
     ``_probe_expert_cos(W=None)``, which already take ``(..., K, hidden)``. Reuse, not a copy.

 11. WEIGHT-SPACE REPULSION needs a definition that does not exist for one matrix: the per-
     expert "weight block" is now the pair. Defined here as the concatenation
     ``[W1_k ; W2_k]`` flattened, then handed to the base helper.

===============================================================================================
WHAT IS COPIED RATHER THAN IMPORTED, AND WHY
===============================================================================================

Exactly one block: the ~40 lines of ``_forward_sparse`` that turn ``(T, p)`` exact energies
into weights (duplicate-candidate suppression, re-rank, shared max-subtraction, the
proxy-completed denominator). It is expert-kind-agnostic and SHOULD be shared, but it is
INLINE in ``BoltzmannMoEFFEnergy._forward_sparse`` with no seam to call, and energy_ff.py is
frozen while eight runs are live. It is marked ``### COPIED BLOCK`` below.

DRIFT WARNING: if that block changes in energy_ff.py it must change here too. TEST 9 of the
CPU test hashes ``inspect.getsource(BoltzmannMoEFFEnergy._forward_sparse)`` and fails loudly
when it moves. When energy_ff.py is next editable, extract the block as
``_sparse_weights(lg, kept, ref, sel_idx, k, p_cand)`` and have both paths call it.

        THE CORRECT ANALOGUE OF THE HOPFIELD SUBSPACE PROXY, and where it stops being one.

        Hopfield's ``proxy_kind="subspace"`` computes ``mean_j gelu((B_k a_k)_j)^2 * s_k + b_k``
        with ``a_k = V_k^T x`` and ``B_k = W_k V_k``, so that ``B_k a_k = W_k P_k x`` EXACTLY
        for ``P_k = V_k V_k^T``: the only error is the rank truncation, not the function class.

        WHERE THE ANALOGY HOLDS. The same construction works here, once per matrix:
            a1 = V1_k^T x,  u = B1_k a1 = W1_k P1 x        B1_k = W1_k V1_k
            a2 = V2_k^T x,  v = B2_k a2 = W2_k P2 x        B2_k = W2_k V2_k
            E_hat_k = -sqrt(I_e) * mean_j( phi(u_j) * v_j ) * s_k + b_k
        The ``-sqrt(I_e) * mean`` is the same number as ``-1/sqrt(I_e) * sum`` when m = I_e, so
        at ``r = d``, ``m = I_e`` and orthonormal V this reproduces the exact energy BIT FOR BIT
        (TEST 10 of the CPU test measures ~1e-16). So the function class is right and, exactly
        as for Hopfield, truncation is the only error -- PROVIDED m = I_e.

        WHERE IT DOES NOT HOLD -- and this is the one genuinely non-mechanical step:

        (a) TWO SUBSPACES, NOT ONE. There is no single SVD of a pair. Separate bases are used
            (2*K*d*r MACs instead of K*d*r, still ~0.1% of the mixture) because that is what
            admits an exact per-matrix SVD warm start. A single shared basis would have to span
            the union of the two row spaces, i.e. ~r/2 of effective rank each, and its
            "principled" init (right singular vectors of the stacked [W1;W2]) optimises
            Frobenius error of the stack, which is not the error of the PRODUCT.

        (b) THE m-ROW SUBSAMPLE IS NOT AN UNBIASED ESTIMATOR HERE. Hopfield's energy is a MEAN
            of NONNEGATIVE terms, so m rows estimate it with relative error ~1/sqrt(m). This
            energy is a SUM OF SIGNED terms -- ``v = W2 x`` has no sign constraint -- so it is
            O(sqrt(I_e)*term), not O(I_e*term), and the subsample's relative error is
            ~sqrt(I_e/m): 210% at I_e=2240, m=512. MEASURED, TEST 8. Consequence: with m = I_e
            the proxy costs K*I_e elementwise per token, which EXCEEDS the sparse mixture's own
            cf*k*I_e (6.4x at K=16, k=2, cf=1.25) and defeats the purpose; with m < I_e the head
            is a LEARNED low-dimensional bilinear form that must be distilled, and its SVD warm
            start is a heuristic rather than an estimator. `_proxy_subsample_is_unbiased` records
            which regime this instance is in.

        (c) A FORM WITH NO HOPFIELD ANALOGUE EXISTS: ``proxy_kind="bilinear"``. Because
            ``gelu(u) ~ u * sigmoid(1.702 u)``, freezing the gate to its mean makes the energy a
            pure QUADRATIC FORM ``-I_e^-0.5 * gbar * x^T (W1^T W2) x``, whose rank-r
            factorisation ``sum_i lambda_i (v_i . x)^2`` needs 2*d*r MACs and r elementwise --
            NO I_e axis at all, which is exactly what (b) says the subspace form cannot give us.
            Hopfield has no such form: its linearisation is ``||W x||^2``, MEASURED at ~0% top-1
            agreement (HANDOFF 7.6) because gelu(z)^2 is not pointwise proportional to z^2.
            ⚠ THE SAME FAILURE MODE APPLIES HERE IN KIND: dropping the gate keeps the terms
            where ``W1 x < 0``, which the true energy suppresses. It is milder (the gate is a
            smooth 0->1 factor rather than a hard rectifier of a squared quantity) but it is NOT
            measured, and HANDOFF 12.11's negative result for the quad head is the prior. Do not
            report a `bilinear` speedup without a top-k agreement number from
            `calibrate_proxy_router_20260916.py`-style fitting on a TRAINED checkpoint.

        rows of ``U S``; doing that INDEPENDENTLY for W1 and W2 pairs mismatched coordinates and
        computes a quantity unrelated to the energy -- silently, with no shape error. A single
        row set is chosen here, scored by ``||B1_row|| * ||B2_row||``.
        That score is a HEURISTIC, not an energy-preserving subsample: the summands cancel, so
        the largest ones do not carry most of the sum (module docstring §8). `proxy_scale` is
        left at 1 and distillation is expected to do the rest.

        bilinear: eigendecomposition of the SYMMETRIC PART of ``M_k = W1_k^T W2_k`` (only the
        symmetric part contributes to ``x^T M x``), top-r by |eigenvalue|, split as
        ``A_i = v_i sqrt|l_i|``, ``B_i = sign(l_i) v_i sqrt|l_i|``, so
        ``(A^T x).(B^T x) = sum_i l_i (v_i.x)^2 = x^T M_r x``. `proxy_scale` starts at 0.5, the
        mean of the gelu gate.
